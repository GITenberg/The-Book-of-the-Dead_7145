description: '& Quot;The Book of Dead" is the common name for the ancient Egyptian
  funerary text known as "Spells of Coming" (or "Going") "Forth By Day." The Book
  of the Dead was a description of the ancient Egyptian conception of the afterlife
  and a collection of hymns, spells, and instructions to allow the deceased to pass
  through obstacles in the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written
  on a papyrus scroll and placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased-
  Excerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.'
